# Car-Accident-Avoidance
 A graduation project technically sponsored by Valeo, The project is a proof of concept to connect the artificial intelligence technology with IoT technology where the problem was detecting the cars accidents in the road by the front camera of the car and send it to the other cars in the road by V2V algorithm of IoT.
 
• Phase 1: Creating an environment to get data for deep learning model through Gazebo simulator using ROS.

• Phase 2: Accident detection through a deep learning computer vision based model.

• Phase 3: Sending the data through IoT using V2V on GNU Radio and USRP.
